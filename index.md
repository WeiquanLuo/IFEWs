- Abundant production of corn, around 60% goes to ethanol production
- Heavy use of fertilizers to maximize crop yield
- High drainage water flux transports excess nitrogen to the Gulf of Mexico forming the hypoxic dead zone 

# Iowa Food-Energy-Water (IFEW) challenges

- Complex geospatial and geopolitical relationship of Iowa farms, water tiers and energy production  
- Diverse stakeholders influence the IFEW system
